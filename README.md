Hello world!

Hi! This is a short description of me, I am a 24 years old Brazilian and Systems Analyst.
This is my non-professional account to work on various hobby projects or simply to screw around in, if you wish to see my professional
account, please contact me (through my twitter, my e-mail, DMing, etc) and ask me, depending on your reasons I reserve the right to
refuse or accept your request.

I love coding, video games, anime and anything related to those three! If you would like to speak about those, or perhaps have a project
involving those, feel free to contact me, I would love to talk about it if I'm available!

And finally, some recommendations:

Read Higurashi no Naku Koro ni
Read Umineko no Naku Koro ni
Read Grisaia no Kajitsu (and the Grisaia trilogy in general, this includes Meikyuu and Rakuen)
And if you'd like more info on how to obtain those or other Visual Novel recommendations, feel free to contact me!
